# Job-Salary-Predictor
Used Decision Tree, XGB and Random Forest to determine which factors most significantly influence the salary an employee receives.

We aim to predict the most relevant variables that affect how much salary is received by an employee, based on aspects of experience level, job category, work setting and company size. We used dataset from Kaggle on the 2024 Jobs and Salaries in the Data Field.

Within this repository, we have used various exploratory data analysis techniques to identify the key variables which affect the amount of salary received. We have utilised three different machine learning models (Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) to predict which factor(s) most significantly affect an employee's salary. With this information, employees will be able to understand what kind of salary they should be expecting with the kind of skills and experience they possess.
